      p.text-muted Gene-Disease Relationships: A gene is a sequence of DNA that serves as a blueprint for other biomolecules. Genes are transcribed to mRNA and the mRNA gene transcript is translated to proteins. There are three options for Gene-Disease Relationships:
      p.text-muted <strong>"altered expression is associated with"</strong> – Altered gene expression refers to changes in the amount of gene product synthesis. This can happen at transcription or translation. Either way, changes in the amount of gene product synthesis is associated with the disease
      p <strong>"mutation is associated with"</strong> – A mutation is a permanent change in the DNA sequence that makes up the gene. Changing the blueprint can change the biomolecules that are built from that blueprint and is associated with the disease.
