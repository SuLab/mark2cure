    p.paragraph.no-interactive <span class='user_annotated'>Biomedical research</span> literature is growing rapidly around the world, making it hard for researchers to acquire all the new, relevant information. By joining Mark2Cure, as a <span class='user_annotated_green'>citizen scientist</span>, I am helping to identify relationships between concepts in <span class='user_annotated'>biomedical research</span> so that scientists will hopefully be able to uncover new treatment strategies faster. I contribute to Mark2Cure because I am ready to help.
