          li
            p <strong>Disease</strong> – a particular abnormal, pathological condition that affects part or all of an organism
          li

          li
            p <strong>Symptom</strong> – the physical manifestations of a disease
          li
            p <strong>Signs/diagnostic signs</strong> – symptoms or test results that support a disease diagnosis. These generally exclude genetic tests, which often define (as opposed to support) a disease diagnosis.
