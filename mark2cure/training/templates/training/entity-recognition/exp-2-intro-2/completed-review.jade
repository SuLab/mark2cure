        p.paragraph.results Cystic Fibrosis ( CF ) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in both alleles of the <span class="user_annotated_green">cystic fibrosis transmembrane-conductance regulator</span> ( <span class='user_annotated_green'>CFTR</span> ) gene . Mutations affecting the <span class='user_annotated_green'>CFTR</span> protein cause perturbations in mucosal viscosity. In addition to increased mucosal viscosity, CF patients may suffer from hyper-inflammation which has been linked to reduced levels of <span class='user_annotated_green'>CAV1</span> in mouse models of the disease.  Down regulation of <span class='user_annotated_green'>microRNA-199a-5p</span> has been found to restore <span class='user_annotated_green'>CAV1</span> levels in mice. The <span class='user_annotated_green'>MIR199</span> family may be of interest in CF .
