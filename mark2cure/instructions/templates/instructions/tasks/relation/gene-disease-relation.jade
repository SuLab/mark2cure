Altered expression refers to changes in the amount of gene product synthesized. This can happen at transcription or translation. Either way, changes in the amount of gene product synthesis is or may be associated with the disease.',

Changing the blueprint can change the biomolecules that are built from that blueprint and is or may be associated with the disease. Mutations range in size; they can affect anywhere from a single DNA base pair to a large piece of a chromosome that includes multiple genes.',

These modifications can have huge effects including changing the location of the protein in the cell, changing its activity, and are or may be associated with the disease.',
