This can trigger the ER stress response (including the Unfolded Protein Response) a cellular stress response crucial for protein homeostasis.  Issues with overactivation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) have been associated with a number of neurodegenerative diseases. N-glycanase 1 is important for cleaving sugar molecules off of proteins allowing them to be degraded.  NGLY1 deficiency would be expected to cause N-glycosylated protein accumulation. Can we learn more about the issues caused by protein accumulation and ultimately the symptoms of NGLY1 by investigating Oxidative stress and UPR? Help us find out!"
