It is hard for scientists to know what to read and to read everything that is relevant.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"clearfix visible-lg-block\"></div>\r\n    <div class=\"col-sm-5\">\r\n      <p><strong>You can help them</strong> by identifying key pieces of information in scientific text.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"col-sm-7\">\r\n      <img src=\"/static/images/about/help-action.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\" />\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n\r\n  <div class=\"row\">\r\n    <div class=\"col-xs-12\">\r\n      <h2>How exactly does Mark2Cure work?</h2>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"col-sm-12\">\r\n      <p>Mark2Cure works by teaching citizen scientists to precisely identify concepts and concept relationships in biomedical text. This is a task that anyone can learn to do and can perform better than any known computer program.  Once these tasks are completed, advanced statistical algorithms take the data provided by the volunteers and use it to provide scientists with new tools for finding the information that they require within the sea of biomedical knowledge.</p>\r\n      <p>For example, scientists often have questions like \u201cHow might one disease, say Ebola, be related to another disease, say Dengue Fever?\u201d.  Such connections may not exist in any one scientific article.  By specifically identifying what diseases (and perhaps other concepts) are represented in each article, it may be possible to find hidden connections.  These hidden connections form the basis for most important new discoveries.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"col-xs-8 col-xs-offset-2 paragraph-box\">\r\n      <img src=\"/static/images/about/ebola_net.png\" style=\"padding: 6px;\" class=\"img-responsive\" />\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n\r\n  <div class=\"row\">\r\n    <div class=\"col-xs-12\">\r\n      <h2>What are the goals of Mark2Cure?</h2>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"col-sm-12\">\r\n      <p>Ultimately, Mark2Cure aims to identify key terms in <strong>ALL</strong> biomedical research abstracts enabling researchers to identify new relationships and ideas that would otherwise remain hidden.</p>\r\n      <p><strong>However, every ambitious project needs an attainable starting goal.</strong></p>\r\n      <p>For Mark2Cure, this goal is to highlight concepts in rare genetic disease research literature. Historically, rare genetic disease researchers have relied heavily on patient communities and foundations to fund their work. Many of the discoveries on rare genetic diseases would not be possible without the highly active and extremely dedicated community of patients/parents of patients. Mark2Cure invites everyone, especially members of these communities, to help researchers spend less time studying research literature, and more time finding a cure.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n\r\n  <div class=\"row\">\r\n    <div class=\"col-xs-12\">\r\n      <h2>Why should you join Mark2Cure?</h2>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"col-sm-12\">\r\n      <ul>\r\n        <li>Keep your mind sharp and flex your brain for a great cause!</li>\r\n        <li>Learn something new!</li>\r\n        <li>Help advance biomedical research!</li>\r\n        <li>Help others while enjoying citizen science!</li>\r\n        <li>Improve your critical reading skills, sharpen your reading comprehension, and build your biomedical vocabulary!</li>\r\n        <li>Put your love for biomedical trivia to work!</li>\r\n        <li>Prove that humans are still better than machines!</li>\r\n        <li>Help change the 'I' in 'Illness' to 'We' in 'Wellness'!</li>\r\n        <li>Influence the selection of future Mark2Cure biomedical research areas</li>\r\n      </ul>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n\r\n  <div class=\"row\">\r\n    <div class=\"col-xs-12\">\r\n      <h2>What is the Current Status of Mark2Cure?</h2>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"col-sm-12\">\r\n      <p>Mark2Cure is currently on its NGLY1 Campaign. The goal of this campaign is to organize information for researchers studying NGLY1 deficiency. Mark2Curators already demonstrated in the beta experiment that citizen scientists and volunteers can and are willing to help.

As of April 2015, there were less than 15 articles on this disease indexed in pubmed; hence, researchers need to investigate potentially related literature in order to find more information. Since many of the symptoms of NGLY1 are observed in other disorders the number of potential related articles can easily balloon into an unmanageable number.  Working with NGLY1.org and NGLY1 researchers, Mark2Cure has identified a set of 10,000 documents of interest.  Your help is needed to organize information in this set of docs. Visit http://Ngly1.org to learn more about this extremely rare disease.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n\r\n </div>\r\n</div>",

We want you if you:<p>\r\n      <ol>\r\n        <li><h4>can read!</h4></li>\r\n        <li><h4>are willing to learn</h4></li>\r\n        <li><h4>want to help</h4></li>\r\n      </ol>\r\n      <p>That\u2019s our criteria for having you join us.  Fit this?  Here are three ways to help us:</p>\r\n      <ol>\r\n        <li>Go to <a href=\"http://mark2cure.org\">http://mark2cure.org</a>. Click 'start now' to train for the task.  Once you've completed all the training steps, do as many of the quests as you can.  You don't have to do everything in one sitting, so come back often and keep contributing. (Please note that the tasks and training on this site are best done from a computer or laptop, with a mouse.)</li>\r\n        <li>Give us feedback on anything that caught your attention. We improve only if awesome people like you share their experience with us.</li>\r\n        <li>Tell your friends about how you are contributing to science.

It\u2019s one of the reasons why we really suggest the use of a mouse.  In the meantime, here are workarounds our clever users have come up with:\r\nHighlight words from the bottom line up.  Note that this works because whenever the cursor leaves the grey border, it\u2019s like having a \u2018mouse up\u2019 event.</li>\r\n          <li>Resize your browser.  The page is responsive, so when you resize your browser, you can often move text from one row to the next.  If you resize the browser and get all the words on one line, it makes them easier to highlight.

I\u2019m following directions, but nothing seems to be happening?</strong>\r\n      <p>Prior to the last part of training 4 (machine pre-populated), you will be able to advance only after selecting the correct answer.  If you select incorrect answers (that are close) you will receive specific feedback on what\u2019s wrong.  Read the specific feedback carefully in order to figure out what the correct answer should be.  Don\u2019t hesitate to click on anything that looks correct to you (diseases and symptoms) to learn more about what\u2019s correct and what\u2019s wrong.  You aren\u2019t being graded, at this step, and getting things wrong at this stage will help you be a better Mark2Curator in the long run.</p>\r\n\r\n      <strong>An example of a common specific error and how to use it to find the correct answer:</strong> \r\n      <p>Error message: Sorry, xyz does not appear to be correct (<strong>Please check that your selection contains all required words</strong>)\r\n-This error message suggests that the word you selected is <strong><em>part</em></strong> of the correct answer.  Highlight it as a span with some of the disease-related words adjacent to it to get the correct answer.</p>\r\n\r\n      <strong>I\u2019m in Training 4, and am not getting any feedback like I did in the previous Trainings. What am I doing wrong?</strong>\r\n      <p>The last part of Training 4 is more similar to the quests.  You will receive feedback only after you click on the \u2018submit\u2019 button.  Again, feel free to repeat this step as often as you\u2019d like in order to see how your score changes.</p>\r\n\r\n      <strong>What does the underline mean? Why are there different colors of underlines</strong>\r\n      <p>The underline is the text that your partner selected.  The different colors of underlines indicates the concept type to which the underlined word was assigned by your partner.</p>\r\n      <hr />\r\n\r\n      <a name=\"quests-questions\"></a>\r\n      <h3>The Quests: Common disease marking questions:</h3>\r\n      <p>Please note that these questions and answers are meant to be guidelines as opposed to hard and fast rules.  With natural language tasks like this, there is bound to be ambiguity and exceptions, so it\u2019s more important to use your best judgement given your understanding of the task.</p>\r\n\r\n      <ol>\r\n        <li>\r\n          <h4>Categories of Disorders and Abnormalities</h4>\r\n          <strong>When a reference is made to a disease or syndrome and it is related to a broad category of abnormality, is the general abnormality to be included? (i.e., fragile X syndrome is a genetically homogenous disorder)</strong>\r\n          <p>Categories of disorders and abnormalities could fall under disease classes such as \u2018heart disease\u2019.  Please mark these as well.</p>\r\n        </li>\r\n\r\n        <li>\r\n          <h4>Deficiencies</h4> \r\n          <strong>Do you want to have us indicate all deficiencies? When is a deficiency a disease and when is it just a deficiency (especially in reference to genetic deficiencies)? When is a deficiency a symptom of a disease?</strong>\r\n          <p>In general, a symptom is considered the physical manifestation of the disease.  Genetic deficiencies are usually causes or mechanisms of disease development/progression and not usually considered a symptom.  Again, this is not a rule but a guideline.  There are a lot of exceptions as to when a deficiency should be marked, such as when a deficiency is considered a disease.  An example of this is C3 deficiency.</p>\r\n        </li>\r\n\r\n        <li>\r\n          <h4>Symptoms</h4>\r\n          <strong>With respect to genes, when is a mutation a symptom of a disease?</strong>\r\n          <p>Mutations are often the underlying causes of diseases and NOT considered symptoms.  Therefore you would NOT highlight references to gene mutations.  HOWEVER, there are exceptions.  For example, certain rare genetic disease are often referred to by their specific mutation.  Eg- CDG1a is a specific form of CDG which is sometimes referred to as PMM2-CDG because of the mutation that causes it. In this case, PMM2-CDG is a specific form of the CDG.</p>\r\n        </li>\r\n\r\n        <li>\r\n          <h4>Conditions</h4>\r\n          <strong>Do you want us to capture medical conditions? When is a condition a disease?</strong>\r\n          <p>If a medical condition is a disease or symptom, highlight it.  For example, if the medical condition is \u2018high blood pressure\u2019, which is often considered a symptom of heart disease, you should capture it.</p>\r\n        </li>\r\n \r\n        <li>\r\n          <h4>Disease Modifiers</h4>\r\n          <strong>Sometimes terms such as \u2018Dutch\u2019, \u2018early-onset\u2019, or \u2018hereditary\u2019 will precede a disease term.  Should I mark those as well?</strong>\r\n          <p>This one is probably one of the least clear-cut situation since it depends entirely on the context. If the modifying term specifies a particular form of the disease or is part of the disease name, it should be highlighted.  Otherwise, it should be excluded.  Here are just a few examples of how the context is very important to determining how these should be marked:</p>\r\n\r\n          <p>\u2018<span class=\"user_annotated\">Japanese encephalitis</span> (<span class=\"user_annotated\">JE</span>) is a disease spread through mosquito bites....\u2019\r\n--In this case, the term \u2018Japanese\u2019 is part of the disease name, and should be included.</p>\r\n\r\n          <p>\u2018We studied Dutch <span class=\"user_annotated\">prostate cancer</span> families and found that...\u2019\r\n--In this case, the term \u2018Dutch\u2019 refers to the ethnicity of the families, and is not a specific form of prostate cancer, hence it should NOT be included</p>\r\n\r\n          <p>\u2018One patient was diagnosed with <span class=\"user_annotated\">early-onset Alzheimer disease</span>...\u2019\r\n--In this case, early-onset Alzheimer disease is sometimes used to refer to the familial form of Alzheimer disease.</p>\r\n\r\n          <p>We cannot provide examples for every instance on how these ambiguous situations should be marked.  If it were that easy, a machine algorithm could do it.  This is why we need your help.</p>\r\n      </li>\r\n\r\n      <li>\r\n        <h4>Hyphenated Words</h4>\r\n        <strong>Sometimes a disease name will be used as part of a pronoun, adjective, or adverb. In these cases, the word often gets hyphenated. For example, myotonic dystrophy (DM) is the disorder. Reference is made to the \u201cDM-kinase gene.\u201d The review software does not allow highlighting only the \u201cDM\u201d portion of the term. Should the entire hyphenated term be highlighted even though it is unlikely to be the candidate of a user search?</strong>\r\n        <p>In general, do not highlight the hyphenated term.  Again, this is NOT A RULE, because there are exceptions: eg- PMM2-CDG (such as when it\u2019s a disease name).</p>\r\n\r\n        <br />\r\n        <p>(<a href=\"#\">Top</a>)</p>\r\n\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>",
